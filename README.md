## Checklist

- Responsive Design is implemented

- Redux architecture is designed efficiently for updating version and adding new features

- Routing system is implemented

## Note

- All api integration is implemented correctly but some features didn't implement to the UI because of daily call limitation.

Test project itself is small and simple one but I designed and implemented for lager version and real usability.
